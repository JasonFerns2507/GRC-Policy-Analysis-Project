# GRC Project: Security Policy Gap Analysis

### Objective
This project demonstrates the process of performing a gap analysis on an existing corporate security policy in response to a new business initiative. The goal is to identify outdated or missing controls and recommend specific updates to strengthen the organization's governance posture. This is a foundational skill for any GRC or Information Security Analyst.

### 1. The Scenario
Innovate Inc., a fast-growing tech startup, has just approved a new "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) program. Starting next month, employees will be allowed to use their personal laptops and smartphones to access the company's internal network, email system, and cloud file storage (SharePoint). The goal is to increase flexibility and employee satisfaction. You have been asked to review the existing Acceptable Use Policy to see if it's ready for this change.
